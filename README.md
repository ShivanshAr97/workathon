# Cubicle Carnival
We may have faced a situation of stress and become tired by doing a same set of work repeatedly on a strict deadline. The consequences of burnout may include increased employee absence, lower productivity, and higher turnover, all of which can affect a company's bottom line.

The website Cubicle Carnival is a platform where you can reduce your stress and tiredness by playing some easy yet addictive games like Wordle, 2048, Pong, Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe. It also has features like Jokes on your boss' name to flush out the anger. Also provides soothing music and other sources to learn new skills like reading books, learning new language, learn cooking, learn astronomy and other trending skills and to celebrate other connections.
